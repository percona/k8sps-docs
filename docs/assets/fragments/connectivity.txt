1. You will need password  for the `root` user to access the
    cluster. Use `kubectl get secrets` command to see the list of Secrets
    objects (by default the Secrets object you are interested in has
    `cluster1-secrets` name). Then
    `kubectl get secret cluster1-secrets -o yaml` command will return
    the YAML file with generated Secrets, including the `root` password, which
    should look as follows:

    ```yaml
    ...
    data:
      ...
      root: MWV1VDdZSGxYWHNhcHpYTjF3Ug==
    ```

    Here the actual password is base64-encoded. Use 
    `echo 'MWV1VDdZSGxYWHNhcHpYTjF3Ug==' | base64 --decode` command to bring it
    back to a human-readable form.

2. Run a container with `mysql` tool and connect its console output to your
    terminal. The following command will do this, naming the new Pod
    `percona-client`:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ kubectl run -i --rm --tty percona-client --image=percona:8.0 --restart=Never -- bash -il
    ```

    Executing it may require some time to deploy the correspondent Pod.

3. Now run `mysql` tool in the percona-client command shell using the password
    obtained from the Secret instead of the `<root password>` placeholder:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ mysql -h cluster1-haproxy -uroot -p<root password>
    ```
    
    ??? example "Expected output"

        ```{.text .no-copy}

    The following example will use the MySQL prompt to check the
    `max_connections` variable:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="mysql>"}
    mysql> SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "max_connections";
    ```

    ??? example "Expected output"

        ```{.text .no-copy}
