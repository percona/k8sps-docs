To connect to Percona Server for MySQL you will need the password for the root user. Passwords are stored in the [Secrets :octicons-link-external-16:](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/) object, which was generated during the previous steps.

Here’s how to get it:

1. List the Secrets objects.

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ {{ commandName }} get secrets
    ```
    It will show you the list of Secrets objects (by default the Secrets object you are interested in has `ps-cluster1-secrets` name).

2. Use the following command to get the password of the `root` user.  Substitute `ps-cluster1` with your value, if needed:
    
    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ {{ commandName }} get secret ps-cluster1-secrets -o yaml
    ```
    
    The command returns the YAML file with generated Secrets, including the `root` password, which
    should look as follows:

    ```{.yaml .no-copy}
    ...
    data:
      ...
      root: <base64-encoded-password>
    ```

3. The actual password is base64-encoded. Use the following command to bring it
    back to a human-readable form:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ echo '<base64-encoded-password>' | base64 --decode
    ```

4. Run a container with `mysql` tool and connect its console output to your terminal. The following command will do this, naming the new Pod `percona-client`:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ {{ commandName }} run -i --rm --tty percona-client --image=percona:8.0 --restart=Never -- bash -il
    ```

    It may require some time to execute the command and deploy the correspondent Pod.

5. Now run `mysql` tool in the `percona-client` command shell using the password
    obtained from the Secret instead of the `<root password>` placeholder.
    The command will look different depending on whether the cluster uses load
    balancing with [HAProxy](haproxy-conf.md) (the default behavior) or uses
    [MySQL Router](router-conf.md) (can be used with Group Replication clusters):

    === "If using HAProxy (default)"
        ``` bash
        mysql -h ps-cluster1-haproxy -uroot -p<root password>
        ```

    === "If using MySQL Router"
        ```bash
        mysql -h ps-cluster1-router -uroot -p<root password>
        ```

        ```{.text .no-copy}

    The following example uses the MySQL prompt to check the
    `max_connections` variable:

    ```sql
    SHOW VARIABLES LIKE "max_connections";
    ```

        ```{.text .no-copy}

        | Variable_name   | Value |
