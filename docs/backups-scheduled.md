# Making scheduled backups

Backups schedule is defined in the `backup` section of the Custom
Resource and can be configured via the [deploy/cr.yaml :octicons-link-external-16:](https://github.com/percona/percona-server-mysql-operator/blob/main/deploy/cr.yaml)
file.

1. The `backup.storages` subsection should contain at least one [configured storage](backups-storage.md).

2. The `backup.schedule` subsection allows to actually schedule backups:

    * set the `backup.schedule.name` key to some arbitray backup name (this name
        will be needed later to [restore the bakup](backups-restore.md)).

    * specify the `backup.schedule.schedule` option with the desired backup
        schedule in [crontab format :octicons-link-external-16:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron).

    * set the `backup.schedule.storageName` key to the name of your [already configured storage](backups-storage.md).

    * you can optionally set the `backup.schedule.keep` key to the number of
       backups which should be kept in the storage.

Here is an example of the `deploy/cr.yaml` with a scheduled Saturday night
backup kept on the Amazon S3 storage:

```yaml
...
backup:
  storages:
    s3-us-west:
      type: s3
      s3:
        bucket: S3-BACKUP-BUCKET-NAME-HERE
        region: us-west-2
        credentialsSecret: my-cluster-name-backup-s3
  schedule:
   - name: "sat-night-backup"
     schedule: "0 0 * * 6"
     keep: 3
     storageName: s3-us-west
  ...
```
