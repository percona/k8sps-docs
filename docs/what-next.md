# What's next?

Congratulations! You have completed all the steps in the Get started guide. 

You have the following options to move forward with the Operator:

* Control Pods assignment on specific Kubernetes Nodes by setting up [affinity / anti-affinity](constraints.md)
* Ready to adopt the Operator for production use and need to delete the testing deployment? Use [this guide](delete.md) to do it.
