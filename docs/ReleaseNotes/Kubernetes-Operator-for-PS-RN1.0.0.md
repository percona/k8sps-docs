# Percona Operator for MySQL 1.0.0 ({{date.1_0_0}})

[Installation](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines){.md-button}

Percona Operator for MySQL brings production-grade automation to MySQL deployments on Kubernetes. It handles provisioning, scaling, backups, failover, and upgrades using declarative Custom Resources, thus reducing manual effort and human error. With built-in support for Percona XtraBackup, proxies such as HAProxy or MySQL Router and Percona Toolkit, it ensures resilient, secure, and performant MySQL clusters.

## Release highlights

This release marks the **General Availability (GA) of Percona Operator for MySQL using Percona Server for MySQL with the group replication type**. The asynchronous replication has the Beta status and we don't recommend using it in production yet.

With the GA status of the Operator, you can confidently deploy and run it in production environments, benefiting from long-term maintenance and enterprise-grade reliability.

Alternatively, you may opt for [Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://www.percona.com/doc/kubernetes-operator-for-pxc/index.html), which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.

This release focuses on stability and bug fixing, ensuring the Operator is ready for production use. Additionally, it introduces these improvements:

### Seamless Operator lifecycle management on OpenShift OLM

The Operator images are passing official certification for OpenShift. When passed, this unlocks full support for the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) so that you can install, upgrade and manage the Operator's lifecycle directly from the OpenShift console.

What this means for you:

* Simplified installation: Deploy Operators directly from the OpenShift UI with just a few clicks.
*  Streamlined updates: Stay current with automatic or manual updates via OLM.
*  Enterprise-grade assurance: Certified images meet Red Hatâ€™s security and compatibility standards.
* Better integration: Leverage OpenShift-native workflows for lifecycle management, RBAC, and monitoring.
* Scalable operations: Simplify cluster-wide rollouts and reduce manual overhead.

All OpenShift-related features will become available to users as soon as certification is confirmed. Whether you're a platform engineer, DBA, or architect, this advancement will bring you closer to a secure, scalable, and policy-driven infrastructure.

### Streamlined custom configuration usage for backup and restore processes

In previous version we have added the ability to fine-tune backups and restores by defining `xtrabackup`, `xbstream`, and `xbcloud` settings globally via the Custom Resource manifest, or individually via a specific backup / restore manifest. 

In this release we improved how the Operator applies these settings: now individual configuration always takes precedence over global settings. 

With this improvement you have maximum flexibility: you can define consistent default settings for the entire cluster, but still tailor individual backup or restore operations as needed. This way you can optimize performance, troubleshoot, or customize specific scenarios without affecting the global configuration.

## Deprecation, rename and removal

* Changed paths for example configuration files for backups and restores. They are now stored in the `deploy/backup/` folder. Adjust your automation worklfows with this new path, if needed.

## Known limitations

If you defined several schedules for the same remote backup storage, be aware of the following limitations:

1. **Retention policy conflicts.** The Operator only applies retention policies to the first schedule in your configuration. For example, if you set daily backups to keep 5 copies and monthly backups to keep 3 copies, the Operator will only keep 5 total backups in storage, not 8 as you might expect. However, all backup objects will still appear in `kubectl get ps-backup` output.

2. **Concurrent backup conflicts.** When multiple schedules run simultaneously and write to the same storage path, backups can overwrite each other, resulting in incomplete or corrupted data.

To avoid these issues and ensure each schedule maintains its own retention policy, configure separate storage locations for each schedule. Refer to the [documentation](../backups-scheduled.md#managing-multiple-backup-schedules) for more information and  configuration steps.

## Changelog

## Improvements

* [K8SPS-469](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-469) - Improved log message to display clearer and more informative error messages in case of authorization issues to a backup storage.
??? Still open - [K8SPS-516](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-516) - Improved stability and performance for operations involving large datasets.
??? Still open - [K8SPS-537](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-537) - Extended the test suite for the automatic update process to include MySQL version 8.4.

### Fixed bugs

- [K8SPS-491](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-491) - Percona Operator for MySQL  now automatically generates the secrets object in the format `<cluster-name>-secrets`, if it's not explicitly defined in the Custom resource, preventing common startup errors.

* [K8SPS-492](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-492) - Fixed the issue with the Operator sending the unsupported `Error` event type during the Group Replication cluster startup by sending the `Warning` event type instead.  

* [K8SPS-498](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-498) - Stopped unnecessary updates to the `resourceVersion`field of the cluster objects during its initialization.

- [K8SPS-501](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-501) - Fixed the issue with the Operator failing to update the PVC when expanding database volumes by retrying the operation.

??? Still open - [K8SPS-517](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-517) - Fixed an issue that prevented MySQL clone operations from completing successfully due to a default 10-second read timeout, which caused "query interrupted" errors. This was resolved by increasing the default read/write timeouts to 3600 seconds (1 hour) for long-running operations and enhancing error handling for better reliability and debugging.

* [K8SPS-518](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-518) - ConfigMap settings were fixed to ensure proper labels are applied when deploying clusters with various replication and router configurations.

??? Open - [K8SPS-521](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-521) - A specific single-leader election mechanism within group replication is now disabled by default.

* [K8SPS-524](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-524) - Fixed the issue with successful backups displaying the incorrect state description. The state description field is irrelevant for successful backups and is not present.

* [K8SPS-529](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-529) - Removed reconciliation of backups that entered the error state due to underlying configuration issues and keep their state for troubleshooting.

* [K8SPS-533](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-533) - The individual configuration for `xbcloud`, `xbstream` and `xtrabackup` tools specified directly for a backup or a restore object now fully overrides any default arguments set in the cluster's custom resource.

- [K8SPS-535](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-535) - Backup deletion operations no longer display an erroneous failure message when the backup is successfully removed from storage.

* [K8SPS-539](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-539) - Fixed the issue with excessive CPU utilization of the `ps-entrypoint.sh` recovery by adding a backoff mechanism to the file existence check. This improves cluster operation in envionments where CPU resources are a concern.

??? In progress * [K8SPS-548](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-548) - Improved Group Replication self-healing and resolved a sporadic failure where a pod would not become ready after a full cluster crash.

- [K8SPS-550](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-550) - Fixed the issue with service accounts defined for HAProxy Pods via Custom Resource not being applied.

??? Open * [K8SPS-551](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-551) - Fixed the issue with the operator self-healing test on Openshift failing with the `fsGroup: Invalid value: 1001` error  if a network is lost.

* [K8SPS-560](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-560) - Fixed the issue with scheduled backups failing due to conflicting job names when multiple backups run concurrently.

* [K8SPS-564](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-564) - Fixed the issue with both  HAProxy or Router being deployed when both are enabled by validating the configuration and either reporting the error or deploying only one proxy. This prevents unintended dual deployments.

- [K8SPS-565](https://perconadev.atlassian.net/browse/K8SPS-565) - Restores now complete successfully when using an auto-generated secrets name for clusters.
