# *Percona Operator for MySQL* 0.5.0

* **Date**

* **Installation**

    [Installing Percona Operator for MySQL](../System-Requirements.md#installation-guidelines)

Percona Operator for MySQL allows users to deploy MySQL clusters with both asynchronous and group replication topology. This release includes various stability improvements and bug fixes, getting the Operator closer to the General Availability stage. Version 0.5.0 of the Percona Operator for MySQL is still **a tech preview release** and it is **not recommended for production environments**. **As of today, we recommend using** [Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster](https://docs.percona.com/percona-operator-for-mysql/pxc/index.html), which is production-ready and contains everything you need to quickly and consistently deploy and scale MySQL clusters in a Kubernetes-based environment, on-premises or in the cloud.

## Improvements

* {{ k8spsjira(229) }}: Improve security and meet compliance requirements by building the Operator based on Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI) 9 instead of UBI 8

* {{ k8spsjira(166) }}: The Operator now updates certificates at all changes in the Custom Resource `tls` section: this fixes the previous behavior, along to which it didn't do anything related to TLS certificates in case of existing SSL secrets, even in the case of wrong/incomplete `tls` configuration

* {{ k8spsjira(217) }}: The user is now able to customize the MySQL Router configuration with the new [proxy.router.configuration](../operator.md#proxyrouterconfiguration) Custom Resource option

* {{ k8spsjira(141) }}: Add capturing [anonymous telemetry and usage data](../telemetry.md) following the way of other Percona Operators

* {{ k8spsjira(240) }}: TLS encrypted connection can now be used by the Operator for the system users, if available; this allows hardening the cluster security by creating users with `REQUIRE SSL`

* {{ k8spsjira(245) }}: Starting from now, the Operator will check user Secrets for missing items and [generate missing passwords](../users.md#system-users) when needed

* {{ k8spsjira(246) }}: `SERVICE.NAMESPACE.svc` DNS names are now used by the cluster components instead of the longer `SERVICE.NAMESPACE.svc.cluster.local` ones to avoid DNS resolving problems with Kubernetes cluster domains different from `cluster.local` (thanks to Denis Khachyan for contribution)

* {{ k8spsjira(158) }} and {{ k8spsjira(170) }}: The new `delete-ssl` finalizer can now be used to automatically delete objects created for SSL (Secret, certificate, and issuer) in case of cluster deletion

## Bugs Fixed

* {{ k8spsjira(231) }}: Fix missing grants for the replication user to follow the recommendations from the upstream
* {{ k8spsjira(157) }}  Fix a bug that caused mysql Pod definition to contain malformed/empty `configuration-hash` annotation
* {{ k8spsjira(167) }}: Fix a bug that caused the Operator to silently ignore the HAProxy enabled in the Custom Resource options with group replication instead of throwing an error about the unsupported functionality
* {{ k8spsjira(168) }}: The Operator was completely relying on the `tls.issuerConf` Custom Resource option provided by the user and doing no checks, being unable to create the cluster and throwing no clear error message if the issuer was not existing or ready
* {{ k8spsjira(209) }}: Fix a bug due to which the HAProxy disabling for an existing cluster didn't lead to removal of the appropriate Service
* {{ k8spsjira(213) }}: Fix a bug where the Operator didn't check if the `pmmserverkey` was empty in the Secrets object instead of considering the empty `pmmserverkey` secret as non-existing and printing the appropriate log message
* {{ k8spsjira(214) }}: Fix a bug due to which creating a cluster without Orchestrator caused it to get stuck in the `initialized` status instead of switching to the `ready` one after the cluster creation
* {{ k8spsjira(219) }}: Fix a bug due to which scaling down a cluster with group replication caused it to get stuck in the `initialized` status instead of switching to the `ready` one after the size change
* {{ k8spsjira(220) }}: Fix a bug that caused backups to fail when the storage credentials or parameters (such as destination, endpointUrl, etc.) contained special characters
* {{ k8spsjira(222) }}: Fix a bug due to which the Operator was flooding the log with aborted connections error messages because liveness probes were checked without proper connection termination
* {{ k8spsjira(225) }}: Fix a bug where the backup restore process could be started by the user without the specified `destination` or `backupName` fields, resulting in a cluster failure
* {{ k8spsjira(226) }}: Fix a bug due to which the Operator was trying to make a backup with the wrong `clusterName` or `storageName` options instead of checking their validity first
* {{ k8spsjira(227) }}: Fix a bug that prevented the Operator from changing the MySQL Router Service annotations and labels following the corresponding Custom Resource options change

## Supported Platforms

The Operator was developed and tested with Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.32.
Other options may also work but have not been tested.

The following platforms were tested and are officially supported by the Operator
0.5.0:

* [Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine) 1.22 - 1.25
* [Amazon Elastic Container Service for Kubernetes (EKS) :octicons-link-external-16:](https://aws.amazon.com) 1.22 - 1.25
* [Minikube :octicons-link-external-16:](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) 1.29 (based on Kubernetes 1.26)

This list only includes the platforms that the Percona Operators are specifically tested on as part of the release process. Other Kubernetes flavors and versions depend on backward compatibility offered by Kubernetes itself.
