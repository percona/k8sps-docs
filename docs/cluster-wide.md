# Install Percona XtraDB Cluster in multi-namespace (cluster-wide) mode

## Difference between single-namespace and multi-namespace Operator deployment

By default, Percona Operator for MySQL based on Percona XtraDB Cluster functions in a specific Kubernetes
namespace. You can create one during installation (like it is shown in the
[installation instructions](kubernetes.md#install-kubernetes)) or just use the `default`
namespace. This approach allows several Operators to co-exist in one
Kubernetes-based environment, being separated in different namespaces:

Still, sometimes it is more convenient to have one Operator watching for
Percona XtraDB Cluster custom resources in several namespaces.

We recommend running Percona Operator for MySQL in a traditional way,
limited to a specific namespace. But it is possible to run it in so-called
*cluster-wide* mode, one Operator watching several namespaces, if needed:

!!! note

    Please take into account that if several Operators are configured to
    watch the same namespace, it is entirely unpredictable which one will get
    ownership of the Custom Resource in it, so this situation should be avoided.

## Installing the Operator in cluster-wide mode

To use the Operator in such *cluster-wide* mode, you should install it with a
different set of configuration YAML files, which are available in the `deploy`
folder and have filenames with a special `cw-` prefix: e.g.
`deploy/cw-bundle.yaml`.

While using this cluster-wide versions of configuration files, you should set
the following information there:

* `subjects.namespace` option should contain the namespace which will host
    the Operator,

* `WATCH_NAMESPACE` key-value pair in the `env` section should have
    `value` equal to a  comma-separated list of the namespaces to be watched by
    the Operator (or just a blank string to make the Operator deal with
    *all namespaces* in a Kubernetes cluster).

    !!! note

        The list of namespaces to watch is fully supported by the Operator
        starting from the version 1.7 (in the version 1.6 you can only use
        cluster-wide mode with empty `WATCH_NAMESPACE` key to watch all
        namespaces). Also, prior to the version 1.12.0 it was necessary to
        mention the Operator's own namespace in the list of watched namespaces.

    The following simple example shows how to install Operator cluster-wide on
    Kubernetes.


1. First of all, clone the percona-xtradb-cluster-operator repository:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ git clone -b v{{ release }} https://github.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator
    $ cd percona-xtradb-cluster-operator
    ```

2. Let’s suppose that Operator’s namespace should be the `pxc-operator` one.
    Create it as follows:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl create namespace pxc-operator
    ```

    Namespaces to be watched by the Operator should be created in the same way
    if not exist. Let’s say the Operator should watch the `pxc` namespace:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl create namespace pxc
    ```

3. Apply the `deploy/cw-bundle.yaml` file with the following command:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cw-bundle.yaml -n pxc-operator
    ```

4. After the Operator is started, Percona XtraDB Cluster can be created at any
    time by applying the `deploy/cr.yaml` configuration file, like in the case
    of normal installation:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f deploy/cr.yaml -n pxc
    ```

    The creation process will take some time. The process is over when both
    operator and replica set Pods have reached their Running status:

    ``` {.text .no-copy}
    NAME                                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
    cluster1-haproxy-0                                 2/2     Running   0          6m17s
    cluster1-haproxy-1                                 2/2     Running   0          4m59s
    cluster1-haproxy-2                                 2/2     Running   0          4m36s
    cluster1-pxc-0                                     3/3     Running   0          6m17s
    cluster1-pxc-1                                     3/3     Running   0          5m3s
    cluster1-pxc-2                                     3/3     Running   0          3m56s
    percona-xtradb-cluster-operator-79966668bd-rswbk   1/1     Running   0          9m54s
    ```

5. Check the connectivity to the newly created cluster.

    First you will need the login and password for the admin user to access the
    cluster. Use `kubectl get secrets` command to see the list of Secrets
    objects (by default the Secrets object you are interested in has
    `cluster1-secrets` name). 
    You can use the following command to get the password of the `root`
    user:
    
    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl get secrets --namespace=pxc cluster1-secrets --template='{{"{{"}}.data.root | base64decode{{"}}"}}{{"{{"}}"\n"{{"}}"}}'
    ```

    Now run a container with `mysql` tool and connect its console output to your
    terminal. The following command will do this, naming the new Pod
    `percona-client`:

    ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
    $ kubectl run -i --rm --tty percona-client --image=percona:5.7 --restart=Never --env="POD_NAMESPACE=pxc" -- bash -il
    ```
    
    Executing it may require some time to deploy the correspondent Pod.
    
    Now run `mysql` tool in the percona-client command shell using the password
    obtained from the secret instead of the `<root_password>` placeholder. The 
    command will look different depending on whether your cluster provides load
    balancing with [HAProxy](haproxy-conf.md) (the default choice) or
    [ProxySQL](proxysql-conf.md):

    === "with HAProxy (default)"
        ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
        $ mysql -h cluster1-haproxy -uroot -p'<root_password>'
        ```

    === "with ProxySQL"
        ```{.bash data-prompt="$"}
        $ mysql -h cluster1-proxysql -uroot -p'<root_password>'
        ```

!!! note 

    Some Kubernetes-based environments are specifically configured to have
    communication across Namespaces is not allowed by default network policies.
    In this case, you should specifically allow the Operator communication
    across the needed Namespaces. Following the above example, you would need
    to allow ingress traffic for the `pxc-operator` Namespace from the `pxc`
    Namespace, and also from the `default` Namespace. You can do it with the
    NetworkPolicy resource, specified in the YAML file as follows:
    
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
      name: percona
      namespace: pxc-operator
    spec:
      ingress:
      - from:
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: pxc
        - namespaceSelector:
            matchLabels:
              kubernetes.io/metadata.name: default
      podSelector: {}
      policyTypes:
      - Ingress
    ```
    
    Don't forget to apply the resulting file with the usual `kubectl apply`
    command.

    You can find more details about Network Policies [in the official Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/network-policies/). 

## Upgrading the Operator in cluster-wide mode

Cluster-wide Operator is upgraded similarly to a single-namespace one. Both deployment variants provide you with the same three upgradable components:

* the Operator;
* [Custom Resource Definition (CRD)](operator.md),
* Database Management System (Percona XtraDB Cluster).
 
To upgrade the cluster-wide Operator you follow the [standard upgrade scenario](update.md#upgrading-the-operator-and-crd) concerning the Operator's namespace and a different YAML configuration file: the one with a special `cw-` prefix, `deploy/cw-rbac.yaml`. The resulting steps will look as follows.

1. Update the [Custom Resource Definition](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
    for the Operator, taking it from the official repository on Github, and do
    the same for the Role-based access control:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/v{{ release }}/deploy/crd.yaml
    $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator/v{{ release }}/deploy/cw-rbac.yaml
    ```

2. Now you should [apply a patch](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/update-api-object-kubectl-patch/) to your
    deployment, supplying the necessary image name with a newer version tag. You can find the proper
    image name for the current Operator release [in the list of certified images](images.md#custom-registry-images)
    (for older releases, please refer to the [old releases documentation archive](archive.md)).
    For example, updating to the `{{ release }}` version in the `pxc-operator` namespace should look as
    follows.

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl patch deployment percona-xtradb-cluster-operator \
      -p'{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"percona-xtradb-cluster-operator","image":"percona/percona-xtradb-cluster-operator:{{ release }}"}]}}}}' -n pxc-operator
    ```

3. The deployment rollout will be automatically triggered by the applied patch.
    You can track the rollout process in real time with the
    `kubectl rollout status` command with the name of your cluster:

    ``` {.bash data-prompt="$" }
    $ kubectl rollout status deployments percona-xtradb-cluster-operator -n pxc-operator
    ```
